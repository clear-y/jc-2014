Hi there! So you've stumbled upon my blog; perfect timing! I've decided to finally get round to writing about my dev work, and the web dev industry at large.

Mostly I'll be writing about small open source projects that I'm be tinkering around with. First on my agenda is to finally formalise my SASS grid framework that I've been working on piece by piece at work. And then beyond that, who knows?!

So stick around if you're interested in all things HTML/SASS & PHP.
